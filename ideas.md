  **Design Movement**: **Modern Islamic Minimalism (Neo-Andalusian)**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Clarity & Light**: Emphasizing white space and light to symbolize enlightenment and purity.
  2.  **Geometric Harmony**: Using Islamic geometric patterns (Girih) in a subtle, deconstructed way as structural elements rather than just decoration.
  3.  **Serene Authority**: A tone that is both welcoming and authoritative, bridging the gap between traditional institution and modern service.
  4.  **Accessible Sacredness**: Making religious services feel accessible and user-friendly without losing their reverent nature.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  -   **Primary**: **Emerald Green (#047857)** - Represents growth, nature, and traditional Islamic symbolism, but in a deep, modern shade.
  -   **Secondary**: **Sand Gold (#D4AF37)** - Used sparingly for accents, symbolizing value and tradition.
  -   **Background**: **Warm Off-White (#F9FAFB)** - To reduce eye strain and create a paper-like reading experience, reminiscent of classic manuscripts.
  -   **Text**: **Charcoal Grey (#1F2937)** - For high readability and softness compared to pure black.
  -   *Reasoning*: This palette evokes the feeling of a modern mosque interior—clean, illuminated, and peaceful.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  -   **Asymmetric Balance**: Moving away from the standard centered hero. Text on one side, a large, immersive visual on the other that bleeds to the edge.
  -   **Card-Based Modular System**: Content (Q&A, Services) is organized in clean, floating cards with soft shadows, mimicking physical cards or tiles.
  -   **Vertical Rhythm**: Strong vertical alignment lines to guide the eye, inspired by the columns of a mosque.

  **Signature Elements**:
  -   **Subtle Pattern Overlays**: Very low opacity geometric patterns on section backgrounds.
  -   **Arch Motifs**: Using rounded top corners (arch shape) for images and key containers, referencing Islamic architecture.
  -   **Calligraphic Touches**: Using a modern Arabic-style calligraphy font for Bismillah or decorative headers, paired with a clean sans-serif.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  -   **Gentle Elevation**: Hover states lift elements slightly (y-axis translation) with a soft shadow expansion, suggesting lightness.
  -   **Respectful Feedback**: Form submissions and interactions have polite, clear confirmation messages with smooth fade-ins.

  **Animation**:
  -   **Slow Fade-ins**: Elements drift in slowly from the bottom, creating a sense of calm arrival.
  -   **Parallax Patterns**: Background patterns move slightly slower than the foreground content during scroll, adding depth.

  **Typography System**:
  -   **Headings**: **Playfair Display** (Serif) - Elegant, traditional, and authoritative.
  -   **Body**: **Lato** (Sans-serif) - Humanist, legible, and friendly for reading long Q&A texts.
  -   **Hierarchy**: Large, airy headings with generous line height.

  **Design Movement**: **Digital Ummah (Tech-Forward & Vibrant)**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Connectivity**: Visualizing the connection between the community and the institution.
  2.  **Transparency**: Using glassmorphism and layers to suggest openness and transparency in services.
  3.  **Efficiency**: A UI focused on speed and getting answers quickly, borrowing from modern SaaS aesthetics.
  4.  **Youthful Engagement**: Targeting a younger demographic who might be hesitant to visit KUA physically.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  -   **Primary**: **Electric Teal (#0D9488)** - A vibrant, digital-native green that feels fresh and energetic.
  -   **Secondary**: **Deep Indigo (#4338CA)** - Represents wisdom and depth, providing a strong contrast.
  -   **Background**: **Pure White (#FFFFFF)** with **Soft Blue-Grey (#F1F5F9)** sections.
  -   **Accents**: **Coral (#F43F5E)** for urgent CTAs or important notifications.
  -   *Reasoning*: Moving away from "traditional" dull greens to show that KUA is active, alive, and ready to serve the digital generation.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  -   **Split-Screen Hero**: 50/50 split with bold typography on one side and a dynamic 3D illustration or interactive element on the other.
  -   **Masonry Grid**: For the Q&A section, using a masonry layout to handle varying lengths of questions organically.
  -   **Sticky Sidebar**: For navigation on desktop, keeping tools always within reach.

  **Signature Elements**:
  -   **Glassmorphism**: Frosted glass effects on sticky headers and floating action buttons.
  -   **Abstract Blobs**: Organic, flowing shapes in the background to soften the rigid grid.
  -   **Iconography**: Custom, outline-style icons with a splash of color offset.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  -   **Snappy Response**: Buttons have immediate active states (scale down slightly).
  -   **Micro-interactions**: Like buttons explode with small particles; search bar expands on focus.

  **Animation**:
  -   **Staggered Reveals**: List items and cards appear one after another quickly.
  -   **Hover Glows**: Elements emit a soft colored glow on hover rather than just changing color.

  **Typography System**:
  -   **Headings**: **Plus Jakarta Sans** - Geometric, modern, and tech-oriented.
  -   **Body**: **Inter** - Standard, highly legible, and neutral.
  -   **Hierarchy**: Bold weights for headings, high contrast between text and background.

  **Design Movement**: **Nusantara Heritage (Warm & Earthy)**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Local Wisdom**: Reflecting the specific cultural context of Pecalungan/Indonesia.
  2.  **Warmth & Hospitality**: The site should feel like entering a welcoming Javanese home or pendopo.
  3.  **Organic Texture**: Using textures that mimic paper, wood, or fabric.
  4.  **Community Focus**: Highlighting real people and community stories.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  -   **Primary**: **Terracotta (#9A3412)** - Earthy, warm, representing the soil and traditional brick architecture.
  -   **Secondary**: **Sage Green (#577359)** - A muted, natural green representing nature and harmony.
  -   **Background**: **Cream/Beige (#FFFBEB)** - Warm, comforting background.
  -   **Text**: **Dark Brown (#451A03)** - Softer than black, harmonizing with the earth tones.
  -   *Reasoning*: Grounding the digital experience in the physical reality of the local culture.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  -   **Container-Based**: Content is held within clearly defined "containers" with borders, reminiscent of framed artwork or windows.
  -   **Centered Narrative**: A strong central axis for storytelling sections (About Us, History).
  -   **Overlap**: Images slightly overlapping their containers or text blocks to create depth.

  **Signature Elements**:
  -   **Batik Motifs**: Using local Batik patterns as borders or dividers.
  -   **Wood Grain Textures**: Subtle noise or grain on backgrounds.
  -   **Serif Typography**: Using serifs for body text to give a literary, storytelling feel.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  -   **Slow & Deliberate**: Transitions are slower, more graceful.
  -   **Tactile Feel**: Buttons have a "pressed" state that mimics physical buttons.

  **Animation**:
  -   **Slide Up**: Content slides up gently as if rising from the earth.
  -   **Image Zoom**: Subtle zoom-in on images when hovered.

  **Typography System**:
  -   **Headings**: **Merriweather** (Serif) - Traditional, readable, and warm.
  -   **Body**: **Source Sans Pro** (Sans-serif) - A good companion that doesn't compete with the strong serif headings.
  -   **Hierarchy**: Distinctive use of italics for quotes and emphasis.
